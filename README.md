# TETRIS AI

This is a simple attempt at building an AI capable of playing and improving at Tetris. It uses the classic Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing to learn and improve.

## FEATURES

Many features were considered when making this AI and the following were tried and tested:

- Max Height
- Number Of Patches
- Sum Of Depth Of Holes
- Average eight
- Number Of Blocks Above Holes
- Number Of Rows Cleared
- Unevenness
